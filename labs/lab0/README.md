## Submission

Used the `pandoc` tool to generate the PDF report for submission from the `README.md` file, and ensure the report and contents are rendered properly.

The PDF file should be named `your-username-waph-lab0.pdf`, e.g., `phungph-waph-lab0.pdf` 

I have used the 'pandoc -f markdown-implicit_figures README.md --pdf-engine=xelatex -t latex  -o lab0.pdf' command to generate by pdf as I was getting an error.
